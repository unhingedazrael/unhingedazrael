Hey there, you can call me *Az*.

I lean more towards **red team**, and I love developing malware and active directory security.  
I also have experience in **vulnerability research** and **OSINT**.  

When it comes to programming, I know **C++**, **C**, **Go**, and **Python**, but I like **C++** the most.

Oh, and I like you too pooks ðŸ˜¼ (jk)

And just so you know, I'm very friendly - not the type of person to put "nohello" in their bio xd (I get the purpose behind it, no offense).  

So feel free to say hi anytime! I'd love to be your friend :DD
