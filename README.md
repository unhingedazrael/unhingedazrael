Hey there, you can call me **Az**!  

I lean more towards **red team** and am mainly interested in **malware development** and **Active Directory**.  
I also have experience in **vulnerability research** and **OSINT**.  

When it comes to programming, I know **C++**, **C**, **Go**, and **Python**, but I like **C++** the most. 
Oh, and I like you too pooks ðŸ˜¼ (jk)

And just so you know, I'm very friendly - not the type of person to put "nohello" in their bio xd (I get the purpose behind it, no offense).  
So feel free to say hey anytime! I'd love to be your friend :DD
