Hey there, you can call me **Az**.  
I lean more towards **red team ops**. I'm mainly interested in **malware development** and **Active Directory**.  

I'm also knowledgeable in **C++**, **C**, **Golang**, and **Python**, but I like **C++ the most**.  
I have experience in **vulnerability research** and **OSINT**.  

And I like you too pooks ðŸ˜ˆ (jk)  
I'm very friendly â€” not the type of person to put "nohello" in their bio xD (no offense, I get the purpose behind it).  
Feel free to say hey anytime! I'd love to be your friend :DD
